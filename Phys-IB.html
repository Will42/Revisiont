          <hr></hr>
          <h2>1.1 Measurements in Physics</h2>
          <h3>Quantities and units</h3>
          <p>Fundamental quantities are quantities from which all other quantities are expressed in terms of. For example in the density equation $ρ = {m \over V}$ only mass is a fundamental (volume being the product of three lengths, another fundamental unit), density and volume are said to be <b>derived quantities</b>.</p>
          <p>To prevent confusion on conversions of multiple scales of units, there is a worldwide standard for units called SI - <i>Système international d'unités</i>. The SI defines both units and prefixes - letters used to form decimal multiples or sub-multiples of the units. The units themselves are classified as being either fundamental (or <i>base</i>), derived, and supplementary. There are only two supplementary units: the radian (rad) – the unit of angular measurement and the steradian (sr) – the unit of “solid angle”.</p>
          <h3>Fundamental and derived units</h3>
          <p>In SI units there are only seven <b>fundamental units</b>. These are:</p>
          <p><b>metre (m):</b> the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of $1 \over 299 792 458$ of a second.</p>
          <p><b>kilogram (kg):</b> mass equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures at Sèveres, near Paris.</p>
          <p><b>second (s):</b> the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom</p>
          <p><b>ampere (A):</b> that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of in nite length, negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 m apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 × 10<sup>–7</sup> newtons per metre of length.</p>
          <p><b>kelvin (K):</b> the fraction $1 \over 273.16$ of the thermodynamic temperature of the tripple point of water.</p>
          <p><b>mole (mol):</b> the amount of substance of a system that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon–12. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be speci ed and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or speci ed groups of such particles.</p>
          <p><b>candela (cd):</b>  the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 10<sup>12</sup> hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of $1 \over 683$ watt per steradian.</p>
          <h3>Significant Figures</h3>
          <p>Scientists use a method of rounding to a certain number of significant figures (often abbreviated to s.f.). Here "significant" means meaningful.</p>
          <p><b>Rules for using significant figures:</b></p>
          <p>A digit that is not a zero will always be significant – 683 is three significant  figures (3 s.f.).</p>
          <p>Zeros that occur sandwiched between non-zero digits are always significant – 5802 (4 s.f.); 19.0405 (6 s.f.).</p>
          <p>Non-sandwiched zeros that occur to the left of a non-zero digit are not significant – 0.389 (3 s.f); 0.093 (2 s.f.).
          <p>Zeros that occur to the right of the decimal point are significant, provided that they are to the right of a non-zero digit – 1.034 (4 s.f.); 1.00 (3 s.f.); 0.34500 (5 s.f.); 0.003 (1 s.f.).</p>
          <p>When there is no decimal point, trailing zeros are not significant (to make them significant there needs to be a decimal point) – 400 (1 s.f.); 400. (3 s.f.) – but this is rarely written.</p>
          <p>For addition and subtraction, leave your answers in terms of the least number of decimal places. For multiplying or dividing leave your answers to the least number of significant figures from the quantities used in the question.</p>
          <h3>Scientific notation</h3>
          <p>Scientific notation is a mathematical expression used to represent a decimal number between 1 and 10 multiplied by ten, so you can write large numbers using less digits. An example of scientific notation is when you write 6.34 x 10³ for 6340.</p>
          <p><b>Metric multipliers (prefixes)</b></p>
          <p>There is another way of abbreviating units: by using metric multipliers (usually called “prefixes”). An SI prefix is a name or associated symbol that is written before a unit to indicate the appropriate power of 10. So instead of writing 2.5 × 10<sup>12</sup> J we could alternatively write this as 2.5 TJ (terajoule). These prefixes can be found in the data booklet used in IB examinations.</p>
          <h3>Orders of magnitude</h3>
          <p>It is important to understand whether or not the physics or the value calculated in physics is <i>sensible or resonable.</i> A number rounded to the nearest 10 is known as an <b>order of magnitude</b>. For example, for the average mass of a human being: around 60-80 kg - powers of 10<sup>2</sup> should be used rather than 10<sup>1</sup> as it is closer to 100 kg than 10 kg. </p>
          <h3>Estimation</h3>
          <p>Estimation is used to produce a value that is a useable approximation to the true value. Estimation is related to finding orders of magnitude, but may result in a value more precise than the nearest power of 10. For example whenever you use a ruler calibrated in millimetres you can accurately measure to a millimetre but will need to estimate to the next $1 \over 10$mm.</p>

          <h2>1.2 Uncertainties and Errors</h2>

          <h3>Uncertainties in measurement</h3>
          <p>No experimental quantity can be measured with 100% accuracy, there is always a degree of <b>uncertainty</b>. There are two types of error that contribute to this uncertainty in scentific readings: systematic and random. </p>
          <h4>Systematic errors</h4>
          <p>These errors occur due to a fault of the system. this could be due to faulty equipment or apparatus. For example digital equipment may be incorrectly calibrated due to the way it was manufactured or due to being overused. On a piece of equipment such as a mass balance the zero setting can drift such that it no longer reads zero when it should. This is called a <b>zero error</b>. Systematic errors can also be due to faults in the experiment and the way it is designed. <b>When systematic errors are small, a measurement is said to be accurate</b>.</p>
          <h4>Random errors</h4>
          <p>Random errors can occur in any measurement but occur most frequently when the experimenter has to estimate the last significant figure when reading a scale. These are likely to cause the results of the measurements to be either too big or too small. For an analogue scale, the uncertainty is ± half of the smallest scale division. For a digital scale, the uncertainty is ± 1 the least significant digit. Repeated tests help to reduce the random errors in an experiment. Readings with small random errors are said to be precise (<b><i>NOT</i></b> accurate).</p>
          <h3>Absolute and fractional uncertainties</h3>
          <p>Absolute uncertainties have the same units as the the quantity itself. Dividing the uncertainty by the value itslef gives a dimensionless quantity and gives the <b>fractional uncertainty</b>. Percentaging the fractional uncertainty gives the <b>percentage uncertainty</b>.</p>
          <h4>Propagation of uncertainties</h4>
          <p>More often than not, measurements gathered from experiments will be used in an equation to determine another quantity. The uncertainty of this calculated value will be determined by a combination of the uncertainties from the measurements used to calculate the new value. This is known as <b>propogation of uncertainties</b>. For the examples below, $a, b, c,$ are the quantities and $\Delta a,  \Delta b,  \Delta c$ are the absolute uncertainties in these quantities.</p>
          <h4>Addition and subtraction</h4>
          <p>For adding or subtracting quantities, just add together their absolute uncertainties.</p>
          <p>If $a = b + c$ or $a = b - c$ then $ \Delta a = \Delta b + \Delta c$</p>
          <h4>Multiplication and division</h4>
          <p>When multiplying or dividing quantities then the calculated quantitiy's uncertainty is the sum of their fractional or percentage uncertainties.</p>
          <p>If $a = bc$ or $a = {b \over c}$</p>
          <p>then ${\Delta a \over a} = {\Delta b \over b} + {\Delta c \over c}$</p>
          <h3>Drawing Graphs</h3>
          <p>When plotting graphs uncertainties are represented by adding error bars. Example of error bars shown below:</p>
          <!--Image of graph here please-->
          <!--More on graphs and uncertainties required here-->
          <h2>1.3 Vectors and scalars</h2>
          <h3>Vector and scalar quantites</h3>
          <p><b>Scalar</b> quantities are quantities that only have a magnitude but no specified direction. For example speed is a scalar quantity, it is always positive and has no specified direction.</p>
          <p><b>Vector</b> quantitities are those that have both a magnitude and a direction. For example the vector equivalent for speed is velocity.</p>
          <p>Here are some common examples of vectors and scalars:</p>

          <h3>Representing vector quantities</h3>
          <p>A vector quantity is represented by a line with an arrow. The direction the arrow points in represents the direction of the vector and the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector to a chosen scale. When solving calculations with vectors, it is important to assign one direction as positive and the other as negative. Which way round it is doesn't matter, as long as throughout the calculation it is constant.</p>

          <h3>Instantaneous vs average values</h3>
          <p>Instantaneous speed is the value of speed at the moment in time at which the speed is determined. In a distance-time graph the instantaneous speed is the gradient of the graph at the instant concerned. From a mathematical perspective the instantaneous speed is equal to the rate of change of position with repsect to time.($ds \over dt$). Average speed however is calculated over the whole journey without regard to variations in speed. $$\text{average speed} = {\text{total distance travelled} \over \text{time taken}}$$ For a distance time graph the average speed is equal to the gradient of the straight line that connects the start and end point of the time interval concerned.</p>
          <h3>Motion and graphs</h3>
          <!--Need to include I and II use graphing software to draw graphs-->

          <p>Figure 1 shows a distance-time graph. A distance time graph shows distance travelled from source on the y axis and time elasped on the x axis. From this graph we can determine the speed by calculating the gradient of the graph. The speed in this case: $\text{speed} = {2500 \over 1500} \approx 1.7 \text{ms}^2$. The area under the curve of a distance-time graph does not produce anything useful. A linear line indicates constant speed, a curved line indicates either acceleration or deceleration.</p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows a velocity-time graph. The gradient of a velocity-time graph shows the acceleration at the given instance. The area underneath the curve is the distance travelled.</p>
          <h3>The "<i>suvat</i>" equations of motion</h3>
          <p><b>s</b> - displacement</p>
          <p><b>u</b> - initial velocity/speed</p>
          <p><b>v</b> - final velocity/speed</p>
          <p><b>a</b> - acceleration 
          <p><b>t</b> - time taken to travel the distance s.</p>
          <p>Analysis of the distance-time and speed-time graph lead to a set of equations useful in motion calculations. These equations are known as the suvat equations or the <i>kinematic</i> equations of motion.</p>
          <!--Suvat equations here-->
          <h3>Projectile motion</h3>
          <p>Considering projectile motion in two dimensions there are two components to projectile motion. There is the horizontal component and the vertical component. An object moving in projectile motion. Take for example a ball being projected from a cannon. The ball will move horizontally and vertically at the same time but the vertical and horizontal are independant of one another. Assuming that air resistance is negligible, there are no forces in the horizontal direction, so there is no horizontal acceleration. There is a constant vertical force acting downward (gravity, -9.81ms<sup>2</sup>), acceleration due to gravity.</p>
          <img src="./Images/ProjectileMotion.png">
          <h3>Fluid resistance and free-fall</h3>
          <p>When an object moves through a fluid (liquid or gas) there will be frictional fluid resistance that acts against the direction of movement. This will affect the object's motion through the fluid. The drag force produced depends upon the <b>relative</b> velocity of the object with respect to the fluid, <b>shape and size</b> of the object and the viscosity of the fluid used.</p>

          <h3>Newton's laws of motion</h3>
          <h4>Newton's first law</h4>
          <p>Newton's first law of motion states that "an object continues to remain stationary or to move at a constant velocity unless an external force acts on it." All this law says is that a resultant force will lead to acceleration. When the resultant force on an object then it is said to be in <b>translational equilibrium</b>. Mathematically: $\Sigma F = zero$</p>

          <h4>Newton's second law</h4>
          <p>Newton's second law states that: <b>Force = mass $\times$ acceleration</b> or $F = ma$ where the <b><i>resultant</i> force (F)</b> is in newtons, the mass (m) is in kilograms and the acceleration (a) is in ms<sup>-2</sup></p>
          <p>This is the simplified version of the formula, used when there is a constant force acting on a constant mass giving a constant acceleration. If the force or mass is changing then the equation to use is: $$F = {\Delta p \over \Delta t}$$ where $p$ is momentum of a body.</p>
          <h4>Newton's third law</h4>
          <p>Newton's third law of motion states that 'when two bodies interact, the force exerted by one body will be equal and opposite in magnitude to the force exerted on that body by the other. Simply put: <b>Every action has anequal and opposite reaction</b>.</p>

          <h3>Free-body diagrams</h3>

          <h3>Static friction vs dynamic friction</h3>
          <h4>Static friction</h4>
          <p>Static friction occurs when there is no relative movement between the surfaces. The static friction force $F$<sub>f</sub> ≤ $\mu$<sub>s</sub>$R$ where the symbol $\mu$<sub>s</sub> is the coefficient of static friction. The less than or equal symbol means that the static friction force can vary from zero to a maximum value. Within these limits, $F$<sub>f</sub> is equal to the pull or push on an object. When the external force acting on the object is equal to $F$<sub>max</sub> then the block is just about to move. The value of $F$<sub>max</sub> depends upon the nature of the two surfaces in contact and the normal reaction force between the two surfaces. </p>
          <h4>Dynamic friction</h4>
          <p>Dynamic friction occurs when two surfaces in contact move relative to one another. The friction between these surfaces drops from its maximum static value and becomes constant. For dynamic friction: $F$<sub>f</sub> = $\mu$<sub>d</sub>$R$ where $\mu$<sub>d</sub> is the coefficient of dynamic friction.</p=>

          <p>Energy can be transferred from one form to another however the total energy inside a closed system remains constant. This is known as the <b>principle of conservation of enrgy</b> which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Thus it also says that there is no change in total energy in the universe.</p>
          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>Work is done when a force moves its point of application in the direction of the force. In other words: <br/> <i>work done</i> (in Joules) = <i>force exerted</i> (in Newtons) $\times$ <i>distance moved in the direction of the force</i> (in metres).</p>
          <h4>Defining work</h4>
          <p>Work done is measured in Joules and hence is a scalar quantity. It is defined as:</p>
          <img src="./Images/workdef.png">
          <h3>Energy and Power</h3>
          <p>The amount of energy transferred is equal to the work done. Energy is a measure of the work done.</p>
          <p>Equations needed to know:</br><b>Kinetic Energy = ${1 \over 2}mv ^2$</b> where $m$ is the mass in kilograms, $v$ is the velocity in m s$^{-1}$</br> = $p^2 \over 2m$ where $p$ is the momentum in kg m s$^{-1}$ and $m$ is the mass in kg.</br><b>Gravitational potential energy = $mgh$</b> where $m$ is mass in kg, $g$ is the Earth's gravitational field (9.81 N kg$^{-1}$) and $h$ is the height change in m.</br><b>Elastic potential energy = ${1 \over 2} k \Delta x^2$</b> where $k$ is the spring constant in N m$^{-1}$ and $\Delta x$ is the extension in m.</p>
          <p>Power is defined as the RATE at which energy is transferred ie. the rate at which WORK is done. $$\text{Power} = {\text{energy transferred} \over \text{time taken}}$$ $$\text{Power} = {\text{work done} \over \text{time taken}}$$ The SI unit for power is the joule per second (J s$^{-1}$). The more common unit for power is the watt(W). 1 W = 1 J s$^{-1}$. </br> The equation for power can be rearranged: $$\text{power} = {\text{work done} \over \text{time}}$$  $$= \text{force} \times {\text{distance moved by force} \over \text{time}}$$ $$= \text{force} \times \text{speed}$$ So the power needed to move an object travelling at a speed $v$ with a force <i>F</i> is <i>F</i>$v$</p>

          <h3>Efficiency</h3>
          <p>Depending on the situation, energy transferred can be classified as either useful or not. For a light bulb useful energy would be in the form of light whilst the 'wasted' energy would be the thermal energy transferred from electrical energy. The efficiency of an appliance is the ratio of the useful energy to the total energy transferred. As it is a ratio efficiency contains no units and is usually expressed as a percentage. $$\text{efficiency} = {\text{useful work out} \over \text{total energy in}} = {\text{useful power out} \over \text{total power}}$$</p>

          <h2>2.4 Momentum</h2>
          <p>The product of the mass $m$ of an object and its instantaneous velocity $v$ is called the <b>momentum $p$ of the object</b>. Momentum is mass $\times$ velocity <b><i>NOT</i></b> mass $\times$ speed. Momentum is a vector quantity and thus has a direction. When mass and velocity is multiplied together, the product formed, momentum, will have a direction equal to that of the velcity. Momentum has the units <b>kg m s$^{-1}$</b>. If the velocity or mass is changing then the momentum will also be changing. If there is a net resultant force acting on an object then it accelerates. If it accelerates then this causes a change in velocity leading to a change in momentum. Therefore a net force leads to a change in momentum.</p>
          <h3>Collisions and changing momentum</h3>
          <p>Any interaction where momentum has been transfered is called a <b>collision.</b> The <b>principle of conservation of linear momentum</b> states that <b>momentum is always constant is no external force acts on the system.</b> The word 'linear' is used here becuase this is momentum when the objects in question are moving in straight lines.</p>
          <h4>Two objects with the same mass, one initially stationary when no energy is lost</h4>
          <p>This is known as an <b>elastic collision</b> and for it to occur no permanent deformation must occur in the colliding objects and no energy can be released as internal energy (through friction), sound, or any other way. </p>
          <img src="./Images/ElasticEqualMass.png">
          <p>The first object collides with the second stationary object. The first object then stays at rest whilst the second moves off with the same velocity as the first object pre collision. momentum is conserved since: $$m_1 u = m_2 v$$ Because $m_1$ = $m_2$ then $u = v$ so the velocity of one mass before the collision is equal to the velocity of the second mass afterwards. The kinetic energy of the moving mass (whichever mass is moving) is ${1 \over 2} m u^2$ and does not change either.</p>
          <h4>Two objects with different masses when no energy is lost</h4>
          <img src="./Images/ElasticDiffMass.png">
          <p>Again: $m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2$ Here it is harder to eliminate the masses. However we do know that kinetic energy is conserved. Therfore KE<sub>before</sub> = KE<sub>after</sub> as no energy is lost. This means that by summing the kinetic energies before and after the collision we get: $${1 \over 2}m_1 u_1^2 + {1 \over 2}m_2 u_2^2 = {1 \over 2}m_1 v_1^2 + {1 \over 2}m_2 v_2^2$$ These momentum and kinetic energy equations can be solved to show that: $$v_1 = ({{m_1 - m_2} \over {m_1 + m_2}})u_1 + ({{2m_2} \over {m_1 + m_2}})u_2$$ and $$v_2 = ({{m_2 - m_1} \over {m_1 + m_2}})u_2 + ({{2m_1} \over {m_1 + m_2}})u_1$$</p>
          <p>Cases for when mass $m_2$ is stationary and collides with $m_2$:</p>
          <p>Case 1: $m_1$ is much smaller than $m_2$. Using the $v_1$ equation, if $m_1 \ll m_2$ then the first term is roughly $({{-m_2}\over{m_2}})u_1$ which is $-u_1$. The second term is zero becuase $u_2 = 0$. So the small mass "bounces" off the large mass, reversing its direction (shown by the negative sign). The large mass gains speed in the forwards direction. The magnitude of the speed of the larger mass is roughly $({{2m_1} \over {m_2}})u_1$ and this is a small fraction of the original speed of the small mass since $({{2m_1} \over {m_2}})$ is much smaller than 1.</p>
          <p>Case 2: $m_1$ is much greater than $m_2$. Here the original mass loses hardly any speed. The momentum lost by $m_1$ is given to $m_2$ which moves off in the same direction, but at about twice the original speed of $m_1$. Look at both $v$ equations to verify.</p>
          <h4>Two objects colliding when energy is lost</h4>
          <p>When a moving object collides with a stationary one and sticks to it, some of the initial kinetic energy is lost. After the collision there is a single object with a combined mass and single common velocity. This is known as an inelastic collision.</p>
          <img src="./Images/InelasticEnergyLost.png">
          <p>The momentum equation this time is $m_1 u_1 = (m_1 + m_2) v_1$ Rearranging this equation we get: $v_1 = {m_1\over m_1 + m_2}u_1$ which as we expect the final velocity is in the same direction as the initial velocity but it is always smaller.</p>
          <p>For the energy loss, the initial kinetic energy is ${1 \over 2}m_1 u_1^2$ and the final kinetic energy is (substituting in $v_1$) is: $${1 \over 2}(m_1 + m_2){m_1^2 \over (m_1 + m_2)^2}u_1^2$$ $$={1 \over 2}{m_1^2 \over (m_1+m_2)}u_1^2$$ The ratio of $\text{initial kinetic energy} \over \text{final kinetic energy}$ is $(m_1 + m_2) \over m_1$</p>
          <h4>Two objects when energy is gained</h4>
          <p>There are cases where stationary objects gain energy in some way. To demonstrate attach small strong magnets to laboratory dynamics carts such that when they are released the repulsion drive the carts apart.</p>
          <img src="./Images/InelasticEnergyGained.png">
          <p>The initial momentum is zero as neither objects are in motion. After the collision the momentum: $m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = 0$ so $m_1 v_1 = –m_2 v_2$ The objects move in opposite directions. If the masses are equal the speeds are the same with the velocities having negative signs to one another. If the masses are not equal then: ${m_1 \over m_2} = {–v_2 \over v_1}$</p>
          <h3>Energy an momentum</h3>
          <p>Kinetic energy, $E_K = {1 \over 2}mu^2$; momentum, $p = mu$ and therefore $p^2 = m^2 u^2$. So: $$E_K = {p^2\over 2m}$$</p>

          <h3>Applications of momentum conservation</h3>
          <h4>Recoil of a gun</h4>
          <p>When a gun is fired, the gun moves in the opposite direction (backwards) to that of the shell. This can be explained in terms of momentum conservation. To begin with, both the gun and the shell are stationary, the <i>initial</i> momentum is zero. When the gun is fired the shell is propelled in the forwards direction. In this case, a collision occurs where kinetic energy is gained. The explosion from the gun is internal to the system. The explosion generates a gas at high pressure which exerts a force on the shell and hence on the gun as well. The explosive releases energy which is transferred as kinetic energy to the shell and the gun. Since the inital linear momentum was zero and no <i>external</i> force has acted on the system the momentum must continue to be zero. This can only happen if the shell and the gun move in opposite directions. The shell will move very fast because it has a small mass compared to the gun, the gun will move relatively slowly.</p>
          <h4>Water hoses</h4>
          <p>When a garden hose is connected it can start to shoot backwards in unpredictable directions if it is not held when the tap is turned on. The cross-sectional area of the hose is greater than the nozzle from which the water emerges. The mass of water flowing through a point in the hose each second is the same as the mass flowing out of the nozzle. Therfore the speed of the water flowing out of the nozzle needs to be much greater than the speed of the water along the hose.  Therfore water gains momentum as it leaves the hose due to this increased speed. The momentum of the system has to be constant so there must be a force backwards on the end of the hose. The momenum lost by the system per second is (<i>mass of water leaving per second</i>) $\times$ (<i>speed at which water leaves the nozzle – speed in the hose</i>). The mass of water lost per second is $\Delta m \over \Delta t$ and so the momentum lost per second $p$ is ${\Delta m \over \Delta t}(v-u)$ where $v$ is the speed of the water as it leaves the nozzle and $u$ is the speed of the water in the hose.</p>
          <img src="./Images/NozzleCrossSection.png">
          <p>If we know the area A of the nozzle and the density $\rho$ of water then $\Delta m \over \Delta t$ can be determined. From the diagram above the cylinder is the volume of water leaving the nozzle persecond where v is the length and A is the area. The volume of water leaving per second is therefore Av. $\Delta m \over \Delta t$ = (density of water) $\times$ (volume of cylinder) = $\rho$Av.</p>
          <h4>Rocketry</h4>
          <h4>Helicopters</h4>
          <h3>Impusle</h3>
          <p>Newton's second law of motion can be rearranged to get: $a = {(v-u) \over t}$ Eliminating a gives: $F = {m(v–u) \over t}$<br>Which means that $\text{force} = {\text{change in momentum} \over \text{time taken for change}}$ or <i><b>force $\times$ time = change in momentum</b></i></p>
          <p>The product of force and time is called the <b>impulse</b>, with units of N s which is an alternate unit for momentum, kg m s$^{–1}$.</p>
          <h3>Force-time graphs</h3>
          <img src="./Images/Impulse.png">
          <p>If a constant force acts on a mass, the graph of force <i>F</i> against time <i>t</i> will look like the first graph. The shaded area between the curve and the $x$ axis is equivalent to the change in momentum (from $F = {\Delta p \over \Delta t}$). The second graph shows force increasing at a constant rate to a maximum $F_{\text{max}}$ then falls back to zero with a total time <i>T</i>. Here the change in momentum is still the are under the curve calculated by: ${1 \over 2}F_{\text{max}}T$. The final graph shows a variable force against time where there seems to be no obvious relationship between the two. To calculate the area you can estimate the number of squares under the graph and use the are of one square to evaluate the change in momentum.</p>
          <h3>Revisting Newton's Second Law</h3>
          <p>Through the impulse subtopic, we know that $F = {\Delta p \over \Delta t}$. Expanding this we get: $F = {\Delta (mv) \over \Delta t}$. This can be written to show that: $F = m {\Delta v \over \Delta t} + v {\Delta m \over \Delta t}$. The first part represents $\text{mass} \times {\text{change in velocity} \over \text{change in time}}$ which can be simplified to <i>mass $\times$ acceleration</i>. The second part represents the <i><b>instantaneous velocity</b></i> $\times {\text{change in mass} \over \text{change in time}}$. The extra term takes in account what happens when the mass of an accelerating object is changing.</p>
          <h3>Momentum and safety</h3>
          <p>When a car is involved in a collision, the occupant in the car has to lose the same amount of kinetic energy and momentum. This can be via smashing into the windscreen or by being restrained by a seatbelt. With the former case, the time taken for the change in momentum is small, therefore the force will be very large (f $\times$ t = momentum change). The higher the force, the more damage. Seat belts and airbags increase the time taken for occupants in the car to slow down and stop. Thus for a constant change in momentum, a longer stopping time should lead to a smaller and less damaging force.</p>

          <h1 id="top3">Topic 3: Thermal Physics</h1>
          <hr></hr>
          <h2>3.1 Temperature and energy changes</h2>
          <h3>Temperature and energy transfer</h3>
          <p><b>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance.</b> The relative temperature of two objects determines the direction in which energy passes from one object to another; energy will tend to flow from the hotter object to the colder object until both are at the same temperature. When this occurs the objects are in <b>thermal equilibrium</b>. The energy flowing as a result of convection, conduction or thermal radiation is called "heat".</p>
          <p><b>Temperature</b> is a scalar quantity and is measured in units of degrees Celsius ($^\circ$C) or kelvin (K) using a thermometer.</p>

          <h3>Absolute temperature</h3>
          <p>The Celsius temperature scale is based off the tripple point of water. The <b>absolute temperature scale</b> is the standard SI temperature scale which uses the kelvin for units. <b>Absolute temperature</b> is defined to be zero kelvin at absolute zero (the temperature at which all objects have a minimum energy) and 273.16 K at the tripple point of water. An increase of 1 $^\circ$C is an increase of 1 K. Therefore, converting Celsius to absolute temperatures: T(K) = $\theta (^\circ C) + 273$ where T is the absolute temperature and $\theta$ the temperature in Celsius.</p>
          <h3>Internal energy</h3>
          <p>Substances consist of particles in constant motion (except at absolute zero). When energy is transferred to a substance the particles move faster and spread out further away from each other. As their separation increases, their potential also increases. As they move faster the amount of kinetic energy they have increases. <b>The internal energy of a substance is the total of the potential and kinetic energies of all the particles in the substance.</b></p>
          <h3>Specific heat capacity</h3>
          <p>The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance is the energy required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 K. The equation for this is:$$c = {Q \over m \Delta T}$$ where $Q$ is the amount of energy supplied to an object of mass $m$ causing its temperature to rise by $\Delta T$. When $Q$ is in J, $m$ in kg, and $\Delta T$ in K, c will have the units of J kg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$.</p>
          <h3>Specific latent heat</h3>
          <p>When an substance undergoes a phase change, its temperature does not increase. This is because the energy is going to overcoming the intermolecular forces between the molecules.</p>
          <img src="./Images/ThermalGraph.png">
          <p><b>Specific latent heat of fusion</b> is the energy required to change the phase of 1 kg of a substance from a solid to a liquid without any change in temperature.</p>
          <p><b>Specific latent heat of vaporization</b> is the energy required to change the phase of 1 kg of a substance from a liquid to a gas without any change in temperature.</p>
          <p>The equations for specific latent heat take the form: $L = {Q \over m}$.</p>
          <h3>Molecular explanation of phase change</h3>
          <p>Transferring energy to a solid increases it's internal energy. Eventually some of the molecules in the solid move far enough away from one another to lose the influence of the other molecules (intermolecular bonds being broken). When this happens, the kinetic energy of the molecules does not increase, instead the energy is used to increase the potential energy of the molecules. Eventually these groups of molecules are sufficiently free so that the solid has melted. The average kinetic energy of the molecule begins to rise again, increasing the temperature of the liquid. The molecules are breaking away from each other and reforming at an equal rate, thus there is no overall change in potential energy. When the liquid reaches its boiling point, individual molecules break away from the entire liauid and the potential begins to rise once more. Here the mean kinetic energy remains constant until all the molecules have separated from each other.</p>
          <h3>Kinetic theory</h3>
          <h4>Macroscopic/Microscopic</h4>
          <p>The <b>macroscopic</b> point of view considers the system as a whole and sees how it interacts with its surroundings.</br>The <b>microscopic</b> point of view looks inside the system to see how its component parts interact with one another.</p>
          <p>Solids - Macroscopically, solids have a fixed volume and shape. This is becuase the molecules are held in place by strong intermolecular bonds. The molecules are able to vibrate slightly around an average position. The higher the temperature, the larger the vibrations.</br>Liquids - Liquids also have a fixed volume but its shape is defined by the container it's in. These molecules also vibrate but are free to roll around each other.</br>Gases - A gas will always expand to fill the container its in. The molecules are not fixed in place and the intermolecular forces between molecules is very weak.</p>

          <h2>3.2 Modelling a gas</h2>
          <h3>The gas laws</h3>
          <p>An <b>ideal gas</b> follows gas laws under all conditions. Real gases do not do this but they approximate to a real gas as long as pressure is slightly higher than atmospheric pressure. <b>Boyle's law</b> states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. Mathematically: $p \propto {1 \over V}$ (at constant temperature) or $pV = \text{constant}$ (at constant temperature). A graph of this (pressure against volume at constant temperature) is known as an isothermal curve. "Iso" meaning the same and "thermal" meaning temperature.</p>
          <p><b>Charles' law</b> states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure the volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. Mathematically: $V \propto T$ (at constant pressure) or ${V \over T} = \text{constant}$ (at constant pressure).</p>
          <p>The <b>third gas law (pressure law)</b> states for a gas of fixed mass and volume, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. Mathematically: $p \propto T$ (at constant volume) or ${p \over T} = \text{constant}$ (at constant volume).</p>
          <p>Italian physicist Count Amadeo Avagadro found that: <b>the number of particles in a gas at constant temperature and pressure is directly proportional to the volume of the gas</b>. Mathematically: $n \propto V$ (at constant pressure and temperature) or ${n \over V} = \text{constant}$ (at constant pressure and temperature).</p>
          <p>These four gas laws can be combined to give and ideal gas constant $R$ which has the value of apporximately 8.314 J mol$^{-1}$ K${^-1}$. Combining the four gas laws gives the equation of state of an ideal gas: $${pV \over nT} = R \text{ or } pV = nRT$$ Where pressure is measured in pascal (Pa), volume in cubic metre (m$^3$), temperature in kelvin (K), and n is the number of moles in the gas.</p>
          <h3>The mole and the Avagadro constant</h3>
          <p>The mole, mol, is a measure of how much of a substance something has. It is one of the SI base units defined as: <b>the amount of substance having the same number of particles as there are neutron atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12</b>. One mole of a substance will have 6.02 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ atoms or molecules. This is known as the Avagadro constant N<sub>A</sub></p>
